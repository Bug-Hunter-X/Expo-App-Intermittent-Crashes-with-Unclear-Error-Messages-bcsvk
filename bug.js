While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual issue where the application would crash intermittently with a cryptic error message. The error message was not consistent, and it didn't point to any obvious code error. The crash was unpredictable and did not occur under specific circumstances, making it very difficult to debug. The app was using several third-party libraries, and it was not immediately clear whether the problem was within my own code or one of these external libraries.  I had already checked for common problems such as memory leaks and race conditions, but those didn't seem to be the root cause.  The Expo development environment was functioning correctly, and other apps were running without issues.
