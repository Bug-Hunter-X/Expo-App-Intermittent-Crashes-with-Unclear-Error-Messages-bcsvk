The issue was eventually resolved by identifying a race condition within an asynchronous data fetching and processing operation.  The original code had a potential for the application to access data before it had fully loaded, leading to unpredictable crashes. The solution involved introducing a Promise-based approach to ensure data was fully loaded before further processing.  Error handling was also improved, providing more informative error messages in the case of unexpected behavior.

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrative example - simplified)
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await someAsyncOperation();
  // ... data processing immediately without waiting for the data to fully load ...
  // This section could lead to unexpected behavior if the data isn't available yet.
}

//bugSolution.js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const data = await someAsyncOperation();
    if (!data) {
        console.error("Error: Data fetching failed.");
        return;
    }
    // ... process the fully loaded data here ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  }
}
```
